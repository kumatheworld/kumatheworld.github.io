          Personally, I don't like Japanese accent in English. It's just as awkward as listening to a bad singer... In Japanese, there are many words derived from English, but those words are pronounced very differently from their original English words. So basically remembering English words based on Japanese accent will be harmful, but recently I found that it could be useful in some way.

        <!-- <p>
          In general, the pronunciation of an English word is not straightforward from its spelling. For example, ...
          Uh i'm tired
        </p> -->
        <p>
          Here's an example. 2 English words
          <em>assistant</em> and <em>accident</em> have different suffixes -ant and -ent but those suffixes are pronounced in the very same way. So people might get confused as to which is which, but Japanese people will never make a mistake for those suffixes. This is because those words are already translated into Japanese (アシスタント and アクシデント respectively) and they have different suffixes -タント and -デント. Since Japanese people pronounce words just as they are written, those words with different suffixes are pronounced differently. And they will correctly write down those words as the spellings will be made up from the Japanesish pronunciation. So in this case, the Japanese accent certainly helps people remember the spellings.

          There was a time when my middle school English teacher from America couldn't recall the spelling of <em>robot</em>. It was really weird to me because I couldn't imagine that a native speaker wasn't sure about the spelling of that common word. But now I suppose that she might have confused it with something like <em>rob<u>a</u>t</em>, which would be pronounced in the same way. On the other hand, Japanese people will never think <em>rob<u>a</u>t</em> is correct as it would be pronounced as ロバット, which is clearly different than the commonly known word ロボット in Japanese.

          Here I explained how Japanese can be useful to remember English words. But with other languages as well, English words might be pronounced just in the way they are written. So maybe people can make use of their own mother tongue to learn foreign languages.

          By the way, I found an <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Commonly-Confused-Suffixes-ant-vs-ent.htm">article</a> about differences between the 2 suffixes -ant and -ent. Take a look at it if you are interested.
